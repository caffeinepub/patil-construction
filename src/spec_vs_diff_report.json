However, the diff does not provide evidence that a production build/deploy was actually executed successfully or that all runtime asset 404s/build errors are resolved across the site.",

      "requirement": "Build and publish (deploy) the current PATIL Construction website version to production, ensuring the deployment completes successfully without build-time errors (TypeScript compile errors, missing imports, missing static assets, or invalid paths).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows component code/content changes; it contains no evidence of an actual production deployment, build pipeline updates, or verification that TypeScript compilation is error-free and all referenced assets resolve at runtime across the app.",
