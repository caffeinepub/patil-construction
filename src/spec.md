# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Use the uploaded PATIL CONSTRUCTION logo as the site logo so it appears correctly in the header and footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Extract/crop the PATIL CONSTRUCTION mark from the uploaded screenshot and export it as the site logo image at `frontend/public/assets/generated/patil-logo.dim_512x512.png` (transparent background, clear/legible, balanced padding).
- Ensure the existing `LogoMark` usage in the header and footer renders the updated logo asset without broken links.

**User-visible outcome:** The site header and footer display the uploaded PATIL CONSTRUCTION logo clearly on both light and dark backgrounds.
