# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the Contact section’s Business Hours display to “Always Open” and ensure the logo is clearly visible in both the header and footer without changing the logo asset.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Contact section Business Hours card UI to remove the day-by-day schedule and display only “Always Open” (English text).
- Adjust header and footer logo presentation (e.g., sizing, padding, contrasting background, subtle shadow) to improve visibility in light/dark themes while keeping the logo loaded from `/assets/generated/patil-logo.dim_512x512.png` and preserving its aspect ratio.

**User-visible outcome:** The Contact section shows Business Hours as “Always Open,” and the site logo is clearly visible and readable in both the header and footer.
